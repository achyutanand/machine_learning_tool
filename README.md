# machine_learning_tool
Using this code, one can do all the machine learning steps at one place i.e., get a summary of all the variables such as minimum, maximum, percentiles, missing values, etc for numerical, missing and unique values for categorical and a correlation table; plots to see the distribution; data cleaning to treat missing values and outliers; variable transformation tab to transform the variables by exponential, squares, square root, etc, training tab wherein you can choose the target variable and predictor variable and choose from a list of algorithms to train the dataset, testing tab to predict the values, segmentation tab to do clustering
